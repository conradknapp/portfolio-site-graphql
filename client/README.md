## Portfolio Site

This is a project based off of my React-Apollo-GraphQL quickstart Github repo. I've been interested in the ability to lazy load images for a while with the help of the Intersection Observer API. The rough draft of this began with a pen that I created in vanilla JS: https://codepen.io/conradknapp/pen/OQNBbw. The final version of this will allow for visitors to click on the individual images from the home/main page and to like and comment on the projects they choose.
